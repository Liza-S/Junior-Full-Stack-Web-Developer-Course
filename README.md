# Junior Full Stack Web Developer RealFive Course

This is my solution of tasks on the Junior Full Stack Web Developer RealFive Course. Each folder is every practical lesson that contains many tasks. A description of the tasks is contained in each lesson folder. To see the task execution, you need to install [Open Server](https://ospanel.io/download/) and insert a folder with a practical lesson in the domain folder inside the Open Server folder.
